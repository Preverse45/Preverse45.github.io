## About the Game
> 2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. However, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers. \\

## Problem
The actual problem can be found <a href="/problems/2048" target="_blank">here</a>.

## How we solved the problem

#### Game layout
- Game board is created using tkinter's canvas ```tkinter.Canvas```
- The tiles using create rectangle ```canvas.create_rectangle```
- Buttons using ```tkinter.Button``` and ```canvas.create_window```
- And a few more things

So to create the game :-
- We first created a 2D array (size = numTilesX * numTilesY) with all elements as 0 and then change the number of two random elemnts to 2
```
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |           | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |    --->   | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |           | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |           | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
```
- Then the canvas is created based on the 2D array
- Now suppose the user hit the down button then the sequnce of events happen
    - 4 arrays are created depending on the input (in this case 4 array of columns will be created)
    - The all the individual arrays are compressed depending on the input (in this case it will be compressed down)
    - The we iterate through all the arrays and add consecutive number if they are equal
    - Then we compress once more same as before
    - Finally all the rectangles are created again based on the new numbers

    ```
                                  I     II     III    IV               I      II     III    IV
     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |          | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |            | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |
     | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |    --->  | 2 |  | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |   --->     | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |
     | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |          | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |            | 2 |  | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |
     | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 |          | 2 |  | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |            | 2 |  | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |

    ```
    ```
    I      II     III    IV
    | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |          | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |  --->    | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |          | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    | 4 |  | 0 |  | 0 |  | 0 |          | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
    ```
