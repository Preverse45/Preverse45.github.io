# How we Solved this problem
Write LaTeX code to output the following text
![Problem](/newAssets/image_preview.png)

# Solution:

```latex
{\Large \textbf{TASK 2}}
If we take $-1<a<1$, then
$$\hskip-14em\int_0^{\infty}\frac{u^a}{(1+u)^2}du=a!(-a)!\quad(1)$$
By contour integration the left-hand
side of (1) may by shown to be
equal to ${\pi}a/\sin{\pi}a$, thus obtaining
the identity
$z!(-z)!=\frac{(\pi)z}{\sin(\pi)z}.$
```
