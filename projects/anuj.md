# About me
>My name is Anuj Verma, I was born in the city of Kota(Rajasthan). I am a student in the Computer Science Department at IIT Bhilai. I love playing video games. It's not just playing that i love, but also making video games and engines. My dream is to become a "Game Developer", altough I like creating engines more, rather than the game itself, but I have many ideas which can be implemented in the actual games, that is why I like creating both of them. \\
Apart from gaming here are a few things/hobbies that I love :- lawn tennis, cooking, origmai, creating things out of scrap etc :) \\
Currently i am working on a small 2D Engine, which I will later use for making small 2D games.\\
\\
If you have a project I can help with, please get in touch.

# Projects

### My First Game

So this is the first fully working game (including UI and collision detection) that I created. This game is actually a project that I created for a course (Data Structures) during my second semester, altough the instructor never belived that I made it. \\
It is not the best optimized game and can allocate over 1 GB of RAM sometimes (IDK why), but I created this game when I just started programming and learning opengl. \\
Big Thanks to Thin Matrix, without him it would have been really hard and time consuming. He has a really nice series of video tutorial for opengl and concepts for 3D graphics.\\

#### Description of the game
- It's a small 2D game with only two level.
- In order to pass a level you have to kill all the monsters.
- Includes
    - UI
    - Collision Detection and response (a little buggy)
    - Level selector
    - Sprite Animation
- Created using JAVA, OpenGL (<a href="https://www.lwjgl.org/" target="_blank">LWJGL</a>)
- Most of the assets used are from <a href="https://www.gameart2d.com/freebies.html/" target="_blank">this</a> site (More details inside the readme file includes in the game folder)

### 2D Engine (Currently working)
This is my main project that I am currently working on. I started making it in the starting of November 2018, that is why their is nothing much to show right now, but I will keep updaing this section as I work on it more. \\
So this time I am using C++ for this engine and OpenGL as the rendering API. Now like My First game, this engine is far from perfect. But It's optimized (can be optimized more), looks good, and with Box2D physics it just looks fantastic.\\
A big thanks to The Cherno, he taught me many thigs like C++ concepts, general programming, how to write better codes and a lot more. He is currently making videos on "engines" and they are really helpful.\\
