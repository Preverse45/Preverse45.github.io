# About me
>**Heyo!!!!!!!** I'm Surya Teja Ethalapaka. I know you took tried to spell my last name in your mind. Thank you! I appreciate your concern.  I'm a native of "City of Destiny-Visakhapatnam". Recently, I found my interest in music. I'm a book-worm. Reading is now a part of my DNA. "Singer-Songerwriter" I want this to be my tagline. I love people who are brutally honest. So keep in mind, The next time we meet, make sure you speak the truth, only the truth and nothing but the truth.
**_Cheers!_**
