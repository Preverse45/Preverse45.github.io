1.  Create a canvas in Tkinter.  Draw a table of 4
Ã—
4 tiles.  Each tile is a square and of equal
length.
2.  Take the canvas from the previous fill the tiles with numbers from 1 to 15 (randomly).  The
numbers should appear at the center of each tile.  One of tiles would be empty.
3.  Create  four  buttons  for  four  directions  alongwith  the  canvas  prepared  in  the  previous  two
questions.   Clicking  the  appropriate  arrow  will  slide  the  only  square  that  can  move  in  that
direction.  This game is called
Sliding Puzzle
(en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding
puzzle).  Write the
necessary code to make the canvas behave as the board of sliding puzzle.
4.  Take the board made in previous question and with every move check if the puzzle is solved
or not.  If it is solved then it should show a message box, congratulating the user and resuffle
all the numbers.
5.  Use a similar canvas and procedure to make the
